<p>Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
<p>The planned pricing migration we informed you of last week was completed yesterday afternoon. As part of the migration, a small number of sites may have experienced a brief interruption in their recording data, but data collection is running smoothly and the migration was a success.</p>
<p>Following feedback from a few users, we also decided to allow all sites that had been on the old Free Plan to keep their additional team members in perpetuity (up to 10 team members) ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>We appreciate your support during the migration and we can&apos;t wait to share all the amazing new features we&apos;ve got lined up for you in 2023!</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Chris Pattison</p>
