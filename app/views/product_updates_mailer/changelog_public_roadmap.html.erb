<p>Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
<p>At Squeaky, we are always looking for ways to enhance our communication, especially when it comes to sharing how we&apos;re improving our software for you. With that in mind, I&apos;m excited to share two significant updates aimed at providing greater insight into our product development and plans for the future:</p>
<p>1. <b>Introducing our new Changelog</b></p>
<p>Historically, we&apos;ve shared product updates via our blog and summary emails. This has worked well, but it&apos;s fairly labour-intensive, which has meant only sharing updates once per month at most.</p>
<p>To deliver updates about new features, improvements, and bug fixes in a more efficient and timely manner, we're introducing a brand new <a href="https://squeaky.ai/changelog">Changelog</a>. We&apos;ll still send summary emails regarding big and exciting changes from time to time, but the Changelog can be accessed at any time and you&apos;ll receive in-app notifications each time there&apos;s been a new publication in the Changelog too. The changelog is accessible both inside the Squeaky application in the support menu and via <a href="https://squeaky.ai/changelog">our website</a>.</p>
<p>2. <b>Our Public Roadmap is now live</b></p>
<p>To further improve our communications with everyone, we&apos;ve also published a new <a href="https://squeaky.notion.site/24456bd41d144bb0a8c411d129c3f92d?v=b3ec067f9f2c4ff891e46757aad25c68&pvs=4" rel="noreferrer">Public Roadmap</a>. This document provides an overview of all the major upcoming features and improvements to our software, showing what we&apos;re working on “now, next, and later”. Naturally, there are many more tickets behind the scenes for various initiatives, but we&apos;ll try and keep the public view of our roadmap focused on the most product-experience-related matters.</p>
<p>This roadmap is a living document and, aside from adding plenty of other items in the coming weeks, we&apos;ll also adjust the prioritisation of the tasks based on the evolving needs of our users. That means that your feedback is vital! We&apos;ve added a link to a feature request form on the roadmap, or you can access it directly using <a href="https://forms.gle/33Gruf57UECeiXwX8" rel="noreferrer">this link</a>.</p>
<p>We hope these new resources prove useful and we can&apos;t wait to hear all your amazing ideas and feedback.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Chris Pattison<br/>Cofounder & CEO at Squeaky</p>
